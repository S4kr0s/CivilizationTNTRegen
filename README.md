# CivilizationTNTRegen
 This is an old minecraft plugin which listens to block changes caused by explosions and regenerates them after a set time.
 Has compatibility with the CoreProtect Anti-Grief Plugin.
 This plugin is supposed to work on the civilization project server, probably the biggest project of mine.
